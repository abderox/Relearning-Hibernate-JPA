## :bookmark_tabs: __Core concepts__
####  I am aiming to understand the core concepts behind JPA implementations and JDBC , the sequence of calls between the application and that set of interfaces and classes that performs full abstraction which makes is behind the scenes for the developers, for me it is something mandatory to understand the basic concepts before going through the abstraction .
#### this little exercise made me find out the similitude between Symfony architecture and this implementation of JPA , now I understand where all that come from .
